Sales Distribution by Item Fat Content

Sales were analyzed based on the fat content of items, revealing the proportion of sales attributed to 'Low Fat' and 'Regular' items. This helps in understanding customer preference and sales performance for different fat content categories.

Total Sales by Item Type

An in-depth look into sales performance across various item types identified which categories contribute most significantly to overall sales. This insight is crucial for inventory management and marketing strategies.

Fat Content Sales Across Outlet Locations

The study compared sales of 'Low Fat' and 'Regular' items across different outlet location types (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3). This analysis highlights how item fat content preferences vary by geographical or demographic segments associated with outlet locations.

Sales Trend by Outlet Establishment Year

Sales data was aggregated by the establishment year of outlets to observe sales trends over time. This helps in understanding the growth trajectory of sales and the impact of new outlets on the overall business.

Sales Distribution by Outlet Size

Sales were also analyzed based on the size of the outlets (e.g., Small, Medium, High). This provides insights into which outlet sizes generate the most revenue and can inform decisions regarding store expansion or optimization.

Total Sales by Outlet Location Type

Further analysis was conducted to understand the total sales generated by each outlet location type. This helps in identifying high-performing locations and tailoring strategies to specific regional markets.
